    Hello! My name is <b> Savannah Germino</b>. I recently completed a 6 year active duty contract with the <mark> US Air Force </mark> and am now currently a member of the California Air National Guard. I spent my entire enlistment working as a <i> Geospatial Intelligence Analyst </i> and was previously stationed in both southern and northern Virginia.</p>

    <p class="center red"> I currently live in <mark>San Diego, CA</mark> with my Husband of <del>four years </del> five years and our english bulldog, Appa. After leaving active duty, I decided I needed a career change and came across <mark> SDGKU</mark> and felt that the <i>Full Stack Development Immersive</i> course would be a great way to learn the basics and also help me explore the different components within web development.</p>
